## Requirements

- Python3.6
- Pytorch.03 (see: [pytorch installation instuctions](http://pytorch.org/))
- torchvision

## Datasets
This repo is built for remote sensing change detection. We report the performance on two datasets.

- CDD
 - paper: [Change detection in remote sensing images using conditional adversarial networks](https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLII-2/565/2018/isprs-archives-XLII-2-565-2018.pdf)
 
- BCDD
 - paper: [ Fully Convolutional Networks for Multisource Building Extraction From an Open Aerial and Satellite Imagery Data Set](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8444434)

 
### Directory Structure
 
File Structure is as follows:
